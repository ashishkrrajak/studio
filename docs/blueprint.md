## Core Features:

- Project Showcase: Display a gallery of the user's projects, with descriptions and links to live sites or repositories.
- About Me: A visually appealing "About Me" section with a professional headshot and a brief biography.
- Contact Section: Include a contact form, allowing potential clients or employers to reach out directly.
- AI-Powered Project Summaries: Use generative AI to summarize the impact or key technologies for each displayed project. The LLM should use a tool that can help it evaluate whether that impact exists, based on public information, before mentioning it in the output.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted Teal (#63B5A3) to convey professionalism and creativity without being overly flashy.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean and modern look.
- Accent color: Soft Coral (#F08080) to draw attention to key interactive elements such as form buttons or links.
- Clean and readable sans-serif font for body text. Slightly bolder font for headings to create visual hierarchy.
- Minimalist, line-based icons for navigation and social media links. Keep icons consistent in style.
- Use a grid-based layout for a structured and organized presentation. Ensure the site is responsive and looks good on all devices.
- Subtle fade-in animations as the user scrolls to give the site a sense of smoothness. A brief highlight effect on buttons when hovered.
